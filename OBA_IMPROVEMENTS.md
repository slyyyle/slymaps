# OneBusAway Integration Improvements

## Overview

This update significantly improves the OneBusAway (OBA) integration in SlyMaps to make it much more user-friendly. No one wants to search by cryptic IDs like "1_100208" - users want to search for "Route 40" or "Pine Street Station"!

## New Features

### üîç Enhanced Search Bar
- **Smart Transit Search**: Search for routes by friendly names like "Route 40", "Metro 550", or "Link Light Rail"
- **Stop Search**: Find stops by name, street, or nearby landmarks instead of stop codes
- **Unified Search**: Combined search for both places and transit in one interface
- **Nearby Transit Button**: One-click discovery of transit options near your location

### üöå Transit Browser
- **Popular Routes**: Browse and discover frequently used routes in the area
- **Nearby Transit Tab**: Automatically find stops and routes within 800m of your location
- **Route Information**: View route details with proper agency information and colors
- **Interactive Lists**: Click any route or stop to view it on the map

### üó∫Ô∏è Improved User Experience
- **Route Colors**: Routes display with their official agency colors when available
- **Better Labels**: Human-readable route names and descriptions
- **Contextual Information**: Helpful tooltips and descriptions throughout
- **Location-Aware**: Automatically uses your location to prioritize nearby results
